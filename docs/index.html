                <p class="content-section">This site is meant to serve as documentation for the <a href="https://github.com/josh-reeves/practical_arm_assembly">Practical Arm Assembly</a> GitHub repository. Together, the repo and documentation are meant to serve as an introduction to ARM assembly, with the repository providing well-commented code examples and the documentation providing supplemental, in-depth information about the concepts required to understand the code.</p>

                <summary>What is ARM Assembly</summary>
                <p>Assembly languages are low-level programming languages that feature a strong correlation between the instructions the language provides and the machine code instructions the processor is capable of natively understanding. They provide a way to directly invoke the basic arithmetic and logic operations that the processor can perform.</p>
                <p>Because these operations and the way they're performed vary between processor architectures, assembly languages are typically specific to a particular architecture. ARM Assembly is the language for interfacing with processors based on the ARM architecture. For more information, please refer to <a>About ARM Assembly</a> the section of the introduction.</p>

                <summary>Sources</summary>
                <p class="content-section">Originally, the repository was largely based on a single YouTube series, with some notable differences. Since it's creation, however, the repository has deviated from the source material in both content and structer to the point that attributing its contents to a single source is no longer accurate. Instead, please references the Sources section of the Resources page, which should include a more comprehensive list.</p>
