                            <p class="content-section">This site is meant to serve as documentation for the <a href="https://github.com/josh-reeves/practical_arm_assembly">Practical Arm Assembly</a> GitHub repository, which, in turn, is based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn_It163He32Ujm-l_czgEBhbJjOUgFhg">Practical Arm Assembly Tutorial Series</a> by Laurie Wired. Together, the repo and documentation are meant to serve as an introduction for anyone attempting to learn ARM assembly, with the repository providing well-commented code examples and the documentation providing supplemental, in-depth information about the topics covered.</p>

                            <h2>What is ARM Assembly?</h2>
                            <p class="content-section">Assembly languages are low-level programming languages that feature a strong correlation between the instructions the language provides and the machine code instructions the processor is capable of natively understanding. They provide a way to directly invoke the basic arithmetic and logic operations that the processor can perform.</p>
                            <p class="content-section">Because these operations and the way they're performed vary between processor architectures, assembly languages are typically specific to a particular architecture. ARM Assembly is the language for interfacing with processors based on the ARM architecture. For more information, please refer to <a>About ARM Assembly</a> the section of the introduction.</p>
