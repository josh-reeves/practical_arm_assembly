                <summary>Processor Architecture Explained Like I'm Five</summary>
                <p>At a very general level, a processor can be thought of as a group of circuits used to perform basic operations and communicate with each other. These operations usually include basic arithmetic, logical comparisons, memory access circuitry, etc.</p>     
                <p>Each of these circuits has a series of components capable of carrying a charge. These charges are used to represent numbers in a binary format, with the lack of a charge indicating a 0 and the presence of the charge indicating a 1. We refer to these as bits. The number of charges the components in the processor can work with at one time determine the processor's "bit-ness" (i.e. 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.).</p>
                <p>One of the processor's components is used to store values. This is typically a series of very small, very quick memory locations implemented by circuits built directly into the chip. These memory locations are typically used to hold the values that the processor is actively working with.</p>
