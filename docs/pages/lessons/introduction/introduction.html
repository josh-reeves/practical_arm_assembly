                <summary>About ARM Assembly</summary>
                <p>Generally speaking, all computer processors are only capable of understanding a limited set of relatively basic instructions. These instructions typically provide, among other things, basic arithmetic, logical operations and ways to access computer memory. All activity performed by the processor is, at most, an aggregate of these basic operations.</p>
                <p>Assembly languages are low-level programming languages that provide a way to directly invoke these instructions. As opposed to higher-level languages (e.g. Python, Rust, the C variants, etc.), which provide controlled and highly-abstracted access to these operations via relatively human-readable code, assembly languages feature a strong correlation between the instructions they provide to the developer and those the processor is actually able to understand. Due to this correlation, assembly languages are architecture specific. This documentation and the associated repository specifically specifically focus on assembly language for ARM processors.</p>
                <p>The set of instructions a processor can understand and the the manner in which they are carried out are part of it's ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). The ARM standard includes multiple ISAs. Of these, these notes are primarily concerned with the 32-bit A32 ISA and the 64-bit A64 ISA.</p>

                <summary>Why Learn Assembly</summary>
                <p>Due to the level of interaction with the computer's hardware, learning assembly builds a fundamental understanding of how the various operations a computer is instructed to perform are actually carried out. This additional understanding is beneficial for making informed and detailed decisions about the design of programs written in higher-level languages and troubleshooting complex issues where the cause may not be immediately apparent.</p>
                <p>Additionally, because they lack many of the conventions and conveniences of higher-level languages, affective user of assembly requires a deep understanding of the many patterns that comprise modern programming. As with anything, limitations foster creativity and understanding.</p>

                <summary>Getting Started</summary>
                <p>The example source code was written and compiled on a Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu Server 24.04. In order to enage with the material to its fullest, a similar setup is recommended. Any 64-bit ARM processor running on a Debian-based Linux distro should be sufficient. The popular system emulator, <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> can also be used to emulate the necessary architecture.</p>
                <p>Once the system is set up, the toolchains required to assemble and link the code will need to be installed. The 32-bit examples were assembled and linked using the gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi toolchain, which can be installed with the following command:</p>
                <div class="illustration codebox">
                    <p>sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi -y</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The 64-bit examples were assembled and linked with the gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu toolchain, which can be installed with the following command:</p>
                <div class="illustration codebox">
                    <p>sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu -y</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://cpulator.01xz.net/">CPULator</a> site can be used to execute most of the code from the 32-bit examples. This has the benefit of displaying the values held by various components as the program executes, but some commands cannot be accurately emulated (i.e. The system interruped command). Only the 32-bit examples can be executed this way. The 64-bit examples are not supported.</p>
                <p>More detailed instructions for all of the methods described above can be found on the Resources page.</p>
