                <p>The execution of a program's instructions inherently result in a variety of logical conditions and execution parameters. These conditions are referred to as the program's state. The processor can use this information to control the program's flow and behavior. The ARM ISAs provide a variety of manners for tracking and updating this information.</p>
                <div class="a32-content">
                    <h3>The Current Program Status Register</h3>
                    <p>The A32 ISA tracks the program's state in a special register referred to as the Current Program Status Register (CPSR). The CPSR is a 32-bit register where the bits act as a series of fields representing the program's state.</p>
                    <div class="illustration">
                        <p class="emphasized">The layout of the CPSR. Click on the header of any column to expand it:</p>
                        <table class="content-table">
                            <tr class="centered tiny-text">

                            </tr>
                            <tr class="centered code tiny-text">

                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                    <p>The CPSR contains the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The condition flags.</li>
                        <li>The current instruction set state.</li>
                        <li>The execution state bits for the Thumb If-Then instruction.</li>
                        <li>The current endianness.</li>
                        <li>The current processor mode.</li>
                        <li>Interrupt and asynchronous abort disable bits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>The Condition Flags</h3>
                    <p>The condition flags allow instructions to be optionally executed based on the results of other instructions:</p>
                    <ol class="bits">
                        <li>N - Negative condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a negative integer represented with two's complement. Otherwise set to 0.</li>
                        <li>Z - Zero condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a value of 0. Otherwise set to 0.</li>
                        <li>C - Carry condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a carry condition.</li>
                        <li>V - Overflow condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in an overflow condition.</li>
                        <li>Q - Set to 1 to indicate that overflow or saturation occurred in some instructions.</li>
                        <li class="asprge">GE - Greater than or Equal flags.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>The APSR</h3>
                    <p>In order to ensure consistent behavior and protect the integrity of the values in the CPSR, the A32 ISA provides protected access to the condition flags via the APSR (Application Program Status Register). The APSR masks the bits of the CPSR that do not include these conditions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="a64-content">
                    <h3>Process State Fields</h3>
                    <p>The A64 ISA does not provide a CPSR register for tracking the status of the program. Instead, the components of the traditional CPSR can be accessed as Process State Fields physically spread across multiple locations within the processor. The A64 process state fields include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>N, Z, C, and V condition flags (NZCV)</li>
                        <li>Current register width (nRW)</li>
                        <li>Stack pointer selection bit (SPSel)</li>
                        <li>Interrupt disable flags (DAIF)</li>
                        <li>Current exception level (EL)</li>
                        <li>Single step process state bit (SS)</li>
                        <li>Illegal exception return state bit (IL)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>The Condition Flags</h3>
                    <p>Condition flags allow instructions to be optionally executed based on the results of other instructions. A64 stores the NZCV flags in their own register that is considered part of the Process State. The available condition flags include:</p>
                    <ol class="bits">
                        <li>N - Negative condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a negative integer represented with two's complement. Otherwise set to 0.</li>
                        <li>Z - Zero condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a value of 0. Otherwise set to 0.</li>
                        <li>C - Carry condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in a carry condition.</li>
                        <li>V - Overflow condition flag. Set to 1 if an instruction results in an overflow condition.</li>
                    </ol>    
                    <p>For more information regarding the process state fields, refer to the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100076/0100/Instruction-Set-Overview/Overview-of-AArch64-state/Process-State?lang=en">official documentation</a>.</p>

                <div class="a32-content">
                    <p>The A32 ISA allows the contents of the CPSR register to be retrieved via the MRS (PSR to general-purpose register) instruction. The MRS instruction takes two operands:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The general-purpose register into which the contents of the specified program status register (PSR) will be copied.</li>

                    <p>The A64 ISA allows the contents of the various Process State Fields to be retrieved via the MRS (PSR to general-purpose register) instruction. The MRS instruction takes two operands:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The general-purpose register into which the contents of the specified program status register (PSR) or Process State Field will be copied.</li>

                <p>It's important to note that many instructions do not update the current program's status by default. Instead, the A32 and A64 ISAs provide optional methods for indicating that the program's state should be updated based on the result of an operation. While often similar in practice, the implementation of these methods is slightly different:</p>
                <div class="a32-content">
                    <h3>The S Flag</h3>
                    <p>A32 instructions capable of updating the CPSR based on their result include an optional S flag. Including the flag at the end of an eligible instruction indicates that the CPSR should be updated based on that instruction's result:</p>
                    <div class="illustration codebox">
                        <copy-button></copy-button>
                        <p>subs r0, r0, r1 <span class="comment">Subtracts the values in r0 and r1 and stores the result in r0, updating CPSR as needed.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Instructions eligible for use with the S flag are notated throughout these notes with the letter S in parentheses: (S).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="a64-content">
                    <h3>Flag-Setting Instructions</h3>
                    <p>Rather than providing an optional flag for each instruction indicating whether it should update the process state fields, the A64 ISA provides alternate instructions for this purpose. These instructions perform the same operation as their non flag-setting counterparts, updating the process state fields as needed:</p>
                    <div class="illustration codebox">
                        <copy-button></copy-button>
                        <p>subs x0, x0, x1 <span class="comment">Subtracts the values in x0 and x1 and stores the result in x0, updating the process state fields as needed.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Due to the similarities in presentation, instructions that have an alternate version capable of updating flags are presented in the same manner as the A32 ISA: With the S character in parentheses: (S).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Move to Special Register</h3>
                <p>The A32 and A64 ISAs also allow the CPSR and Process State Fields updated with the MSR (Move to System Register) instruction. The MSR instruction takes two operands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The name of the system register or Process State Field to write to.</li>
                    <li>An immediate value or a register containing the value to write to the system register.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="a32-content">
                    <p>Updating the condition flags of the CPSR directly is considered bad practice in newer versions of the A32 ISA. Instead, the flags should be updated via the APSR. This requires the bits of the APSR that should be updated to be specified with with an underscore followed by a string of characters representing the flags to update after the first operand. The available combinations of flags are nzcvq, g, or nzcvqg. Updating the APSR without specifying any bits is considered deprecated behavior in newer versions of ARM.</p>

                <div class="a64-content">
                    <p>For consistency, the N, Z, C and V state fields occupy the same position in their respective 64-bit register as the position of their A32 counterparts in the 32-bit CPSR/APSR. Because of the format in which the A64 instruction expects constant values to be provided, however, it's easiest to move the new value into another register first and copy it from there. The below updates the NZCV state fields via their register:</p>
