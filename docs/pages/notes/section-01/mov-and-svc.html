                <p>ARM assembly is organized into labels: Symbolic references to the memory address of an instruction or piece of data. In order to create an executable program, the symbol representing the program's entry point must be made available to other software. This can be done using the ".global" directive. A directive is a special instruction that controls the assembly process.</p>
                <p>The associated examples use the label "_start" as their entry point. The following code is used at the beginning of each example to export the label using the .global directive:</p>
                <div class="illustration codebox">
                <copy-button></copy-button>
                    <p>.global _start</p>
                </div>
                <p>Next, the label must be created and given a body:</p>
                <div class="illustration codebox">
                    <copy-button></copy-button>
                    <p>.global _start</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>_start:</p>

                <p>One of the components the processor contains is referred to as a register. Registers are typically a series of very small, very quick memory circuits built directly into the chip that can be used to store any data the processor is currently working with and track the system's state.</p>

                <div class="a32-content">
                    <p>A32 Provides access to the following registers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>13 general purpose registers: r0 - r12.</li>
                        <li>3 registers that perform a special function but can be manipulated in the same manner as general purpose registers and used as such: pc, lr and sp.</li>
                        <li>1 application program status register (apsr/cpsr).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The MOV instruction can be used to store a value in one of the general purpose registers. In order to invoke the instruction, it's keyword, or mnemonic, is used along with a series and operands. The MOV instruction takes two operands: The first is the register in which the value will be stored. The second can either be another register, in which case the value stored in that register will be used, or an immediate: A numerical constant denoted with an octothorpe.</p>
                    <p>The code below moves the immediate value 38 into register r0. The use of "0x" at the beginning of the number indicates that the value is being provided in Hexadecimal. Decimal and Binary input are also supported. The mnemonic and register name are not case sensitive:</p>

                            <p>mov r0, #0x26 <span class="comment">// Moves the value 38 (in hexadecimal) into register r0.</span></p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="a64-content">
                    <p>A64 Provides access to the following registers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>31 general purpose registers. These can be either 64-bit (x0 - x30) or 32-bit (w0 - w30).</li>
                        <li>An sp register. Though it can still be used with a subset of operations, this cannot be used as a general purpose register.</li>
                        <li>x30 is also used as the lr register.</li>
                        <li>A set of system registers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The MOV instruction can be used to store a value in one of the general purpose registers. In order to invoke the instruction, it's keyword, or mnemonic, is used along with a series and operands. The MOV instruction takes two operands: The first is the register in which the value will be stored. The second can either be another register, in which case the value stored in that register will be used, or an immediate: A numerical constant denoted with an octothorpe.</p>
                    <p>The code below moves the immediate value 38 into register x0. The use of "0x" at the beginning of the number indicates that the value is being provided in Hexadecimal. Decimal and Binary input are also supported. The mnemonic and register name are not case sensitive:</p>
                    <div class="illustration">

                <h3 id="pc-register">The Program Counter Register</h3>
                <p>If the A32 code above is executed in <a href="https://cpulator.01xz.net/">CPULator</a>, the contents of the processor's registers are displayed on the left during execution. Toward the bottom of the list is a register labeled pc. This is the Program Counter register. The PC is used by the CPU to find the address of the next instruction to be executed. With each instruction executed, it's value increments by that instruction's length in bytes. In both A32 and A64, a typical instruction is 32 bits (4 bytes) in length.</p>
                <div class="illustration">
                    <img src="/practical_arm_assembly/assets/images/pc-register.png" width="300px"></img>
                </div>
                <div class="a32-content">
                    <p>A32 allows the PC register to be treated as a general purpose register, meaning data can be directly written to or read from the register. This allows the flow of the program to altered via the MOV instruction (with some restrictions that our outside the scope of these notes).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="a64-content">
                    <p>Unlike A32, A64 does not allow the PC register to be directly accessed. To obtain the current value of the PC register, the following command can be used:</p>
                    <div class="illustration codebox">
                        <copy-button></copy-button>
                        <p>ADR xD, .</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The ADR command stores the address of an instruction in xD. The "." operand represents "here," which causes the command to return the address of the current instruction. A64 does not allow the PC register to be directly written to.</p>

                <summary><p>Exiting the Program</p><div><button class="a32-toggle inactive">A32</button><button class="a64-toggle">A64</button></summary>
                <p>In order to gracefully end program execution, control must be returned to the operating system. This can be done with a software interrupt. Software interrupts switch the processor into "supervisor" mode, allowing it to make a request of the operating system kernel. This can be used to request that the operating system exit the program.
                
                <div class="a32-content">
                    <p>A system interrupt can be triggered with the svc mnemonic. The action taken when this interrupt is called depends on the value of a predefined register. For A32, this is register r7. The value required to trigger an exit SysCall is 1. The code below moves the appropriate value into r7 and then triggers a software interrupt. Note the value following the svc mnemonic would typically be invalid, as it is neither a register or an immediate. This can be done because this value, while required, is never actually used or parsed by the instruction:</p>
                    <div class="illustration codebox">

                    <p>A system interrupt can be triggered with the svc mnemonic. The action taken when this interrupt is called depends on the value of a predefined register. For A64, this is register x8. The value required to trigger an exit SysCall is 93 (0x5d). The code below moves the appropriate value into x8 and then triggers a software interrupt. Note the value following the svc mnemonic would typically be invalid, as it is neither a register or an immediate. This can be done because this value, while required, is never actually used or parsed by the instruction:</p>

                <p>Assembly source files use a ".s" extension. Before the program can be run, it must be assembled into an object file containing the machine code for the program and then linked into an executable. On a linux system configured with the recommended toolchains, the following commands can be used to assemble the program. More information about the recommended configuration can be found under the Getting Started section of the introduction.</p>

                <p>Assembly source files are organized into labels containing the program's data and instructions. Instructions can be used to store a value in a register: A small storage location built directly into the processor. The PC register is used to track the address of the next instruction to execute. When an assembly program is done executing, the SVC instruction can be used to exit the program gracefully.</p>
